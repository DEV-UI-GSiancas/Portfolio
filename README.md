# Gino Siancas - Portfolio

The branch **master** is used as the build template of my portfolio webiste (https://dev-gsiancas.com). 

The branch **development** is the starting point for all implementation and code practice. Each branch name tries to be the most self-explainatory as possible. Ex:

    branch name: cart-with-context-api-and-reducer 

I applied SOLID principles for all code practice. The styling is with SASS modules and following the BEM Methodology.
